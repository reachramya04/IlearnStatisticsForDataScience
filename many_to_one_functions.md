# Many-to-One Functions

Many-to-one functions map multiple values of a random variable to a single value. This can simplify the analysis but may lose some information.

**Example:**
Consider a random variable \(X\) representing the outcome of rolling a die. The function \(Y = X \mod 2\) maps the outcomes to either 0 (even) or 1 (odd).

**Steps to Solve:**
1. Identify the many-to-one function.
2. Determine the new distribution of the transformed variable.
3. Analyze the impact of the transformation.

**Real-World Application:**
Many-to-one functions are used in data compression, where multiple data points are mapped to a single value to reduce storage requirements.
