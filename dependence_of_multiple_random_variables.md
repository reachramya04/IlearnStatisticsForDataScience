# Dependence of Multiple Random Variables

Multiple random variables \(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n\) are dependent if the occurrence of any one of them affects the probability distribution of the others. This can be measured using joint distributions and covariance matrices.

**Formula:**
The covariance matrix \(\Sigma\) for random variables \(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n\) is given by:
$$ \Sigma_{ij} = \text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) = E[(X_i - E[X_i])(X_j - E[X_j])] $$

**Example:**
Consider the heights, weights, and ages of individuals. These variables are dependent because they are influenced by common factors like genetics and lifestyle.

**Real-World Application:**
Understanding the dependence of multiple random variables is crucial in multivariate analysis, which is used in fields like finance, biology, and social sciences.
