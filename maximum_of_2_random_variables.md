# Maximum of Two Random Variables

## Definition

The maximum of two random variables \(Z = \max(X, Y)\) is a new random variable representing the maximum value between \(X\) and \(Y\).

## Example

Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be the scores of two players in a game. The maximum score \(Z = \max(X, Y)\) represents the highest score achieved.

## Real World Application

In reliability engineering, the maximum of random variables is used to model the maximum stress a system can withstand.
