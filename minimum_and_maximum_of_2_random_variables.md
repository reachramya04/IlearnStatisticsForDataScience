# Minimum and Maximum of Two Random Variables

## Definition

The minimum and maximum of two random variables \(Z_{\min} = \min(X, Y)\) and \(Z_{\max} = \max(X, Y)\) represent the minimum and maximum values between \(X\) and \(Y\).

## Example

Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be the ages of two siblings. The minimum age \(Z_{\min} = \min(X, Y)\) and the maximum age \(Z_{\max} = \max(X, Y)\) represent the younger and older sibling, respectively.

## Real World Application

In environmental science, the minimum and maximum of random variables are used to model extreme weather conditions.
