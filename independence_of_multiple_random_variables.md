# Independence of Multiple Random Variables

Multiple random variables \(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n\) are independent if the occurrence of any one of them does not affect the probability distribution of the others. Mathematically, they are independent if for all \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\):
$$ P(X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, \ldots, X_n = x_n) = P(X_1 = x_1) \cdot P(X_2 = x_2) \cdot \ldots \cdot P(X_n = x_n) $$

**Example:**
Consider rolling three dice. Let \(X_1\), \(X_2\), and \(X_3\) be the outcomes of the first, second, and third die, respectively. Since the outcome of one die does not affect the outcomes of the others, \(X_1\), \(X_2\), and \(X_3\) are independent.

**Real-World Application:**
Independence of multiple random variables is important in designing experiments and simulations where the independence of factors ensures unbiased results.
