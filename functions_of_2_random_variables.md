# Functions of Two Random Variables

## Definition

A function of two random variables \(Z = g(X, Y)\) transforms the random variables \(X\) and \(Y\) into another random variable \(Z\).

## Example

Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be the lengths of two sides of a rectangle. Let \(Z = X \cdot Y\). The variable \(Z\) represents the area of the rectangle.

## Real World Application

In economics, functions of two random variables are used to model the interaction between different economic factors.
