# Introduction to Functions of Two Random Variables

Functions of two random variables involve transformations that depend on two inputs. These functions can be visualized using joint distributions and contour plots.

**Example:**
Consider two independent normal random variables \(X\) and \(Y\). The function \(Z = X + Y\) transforms \(X\) and \(Y\) into a new random variable \(Z\).

**Steps to Solve:**
1. Determine the joint distribution of \(X\) and \(Y\).
2. Apply the transformation to find the distribution of \(Z\).
3. Visualize the joint distribution and the transformation.

**Real-World Application:**
Functions of two random variables are used in signal processing to combine signals from different sources.
