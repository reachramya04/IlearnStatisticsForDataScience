# Examples of Functions of One Random Variable

Understanding functions of one random variable through examples helps in grasping the concept better.

**Example 1:**
Let \(X\) be a uniform random variable on \([0, 1]\). The function \(Y = -\ln(X)\) transforms \(X\) into an exponential random variable.

**Example 2:**
Let \(X\) be a normal random variable. The function \(Y = X^2\) transforms \(X\) into a chi-squared random variable with one degree of freedom.

**Steps to Solve:**
1. Identify the function.
2. Determine the new distribution.
3. Visualize the transformation.

**Real-World Application:**
These transformations are used in reliability engineering to model failure times.
