# Dependence of Two Random Variables

Two random variables \(X\) and \(Y\) are dependent if the occurrence of one affects the probability distribution of the other. This is often measured using correlation or covariance.

**Formula:**
$$ \text{Cov}(X, Y) = E[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y])] $$

**Example:**
Consider the height and weight of individuals. These variables are dependent because taller individuals tend to weigh more.

**Real-World Application:**
Understanding dependence is essential in risk management, where the correlation between different assets can impact the overall risk of a portfolio.
