# Visualization Tips for Random Variables

## 1. Understanding PDFs (Probability Density Functions)

The PDF shows the relative likelihood of different outcomes of a random variable. For example, the height of the PDF at a given point indicates the likelihood of the random variable taking a value close to that point.

### Understanding PDFs (Probability Density Functions) Visualization Tip

- **Tall PDF Peaks**: Higher likelihood of outcomes around that point.
- **Flat PDF Sections**: Equal likelihood across the range.

## 2. Understanding CDFs (Cumulative Distribution Functions)

The CDF represents the cumulative probability up to a certain point. For continuous variables, the CDF increases smoothly, starting at 0 and reaching 1.

### Understanding CDFs (Cumulative Distribution Functions) Visualization Tip

- **Steeper CDF Slopes**: Faster accumulation of probability.
- **Flat CDF**: Represents a region where the variable rarely takes values.

## 3. Comparing Distributions

When plotting multiple distributions (such as the sum or maximum of random variables), use different colors and legends to clearly distinguish them. Overlay PDFs and CDFs for easy comparison.

### Comparing Distributions Visualization Tip

- **Normalized Axis**: Ensure that the x-axis covers the appropriate range for all distributions.
- **Legends and Gridlines**: Always use legends and gridlines to improve clarity.

## 4. Using Convolution to Visualize Sums

When visualizing the sum of independent random variables, the resulting PDF is obtained through convolution of individual PDFs. This creates new, often more complex distributions.

### Using Convolution to Visualize Sums Visualization Tip

- For sums of random variables, expect wider distributions compared to individual variables.
- Triangular distributions often appear for sums of uniform variables.
