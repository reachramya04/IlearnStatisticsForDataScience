# Visualizing Functions of One Random Variable

Visualizing functions of one random variable helps in understanding how transformations affect the distribution of the variable. Common visualizations include histograms, probability density functions (PDFs), and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs).

**Example:**
Consider a random variable \(X\) with a normal distribution. The function \(Y = X^2\) transforms \(X\) into a new random variable \(Y\).

**Steps to Solve:**
1. Determine the PDF of \(X\).
2. Apply the transformation to find the PDF of \(Y\).
3. Visualize the PDF and CDF of \(Y\).

**Real-World Application:**
Visualizing transformations is useful in quality control, where measurements are transformed to assess product quality.
