# Visualizing Functions of Two Random Variables

Visualizing functions of two random variables helps in understanding the interaction between the variables. Common visualizations include joint PDFs, contour plots, and surface plots.

**Example:**
Consider two random variables \(X\) and \(Y\) with a bivariate normal distribution. The function \(Z = X + Y\) transforms \(X\) and \(Y\) into a new random variable \(Z\).

**Steps to Solve:**
1. Determine the joint PDF of \(X\) and \(Y\).
2. Apply the transformation to find the PDF of \(Z\).
3. Visualize the joint PDF and the transformation.

**Real-World Application:**
Visualizing functions of two random variables is useful in finance to model the joint behavior of asset returns.
